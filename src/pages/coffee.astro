  <h1>Coffee</h1>

  <section>
    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>
      Grind whole coffee beans with a burr grinder. I use the Baratza Encore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pour over is simple to brew and makes great coffee. The Hario v60 is easy
      to clean and perfect for single cups. A Chemex is beautiful and perfect
      for sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A French press makes wonderfully full-bodied coffee. Use a coarse grind
      and be patient—the common recommendation is 4 minutes but I've found
      longer is better.

    <h3>Meta</h3>
    <p>Find a spot with a clear surface and nice light.</p>
    <p>Don't be distracted. Set the phone down and do this one thing.</p>
    <p>Use a mug that sparks joy. I like Hasami Porcelain.</p>

    <h3>Chemex instructions</h3>
    <p>
      Open the filter and place it in the Chemex. If you're using their filters
      place the 3-layer side facing the spout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rinse the filter with boiling water. Swirl the water to warm the glass and
      then pour it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly pour the bloom water over the grounds and wait 30–60 seconds for
      CO2 to release.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pour remaining water in batches until you reach the final weight, stirring
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>Pour into your cup and enjoy.</p>
